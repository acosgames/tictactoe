## About Client

Client is built using ReactJS.  It will run inside an iframe and communicate with the parent frame which is the [Simulator's](https://github.com/acosgames/acosgames) client.  

All assets (images, svg, audio) should be packed into a single `client.bundle.js` file.

A browser-sync is included so that your changes are reflected immediately.

## About Server

Server code is built using NodeJS code and bundled into a single `server.bundle.js` file.

## About Simulator

[Simulator](https://github.com/acosgames/acosgames) runs a simple frontend that displays your `client.bundle.js` inside an iframe.  

[Simulator](https://github.com/acosgames/acosgames) also runs a NodeJS express/socket.io server with a worker that uses vm2 to run your `server.bundle.js` code.
